### Mini Universal Terminal Emulator

This is a small project I made, which is supposed to be a UART to SPI converter, meant specifically to act as a terminal emulator for SPI TFT displays.  

Features:  
- EFM8BB10F8G Silicon Labs microcontroller
- FT232RL USB 2.0 to UART bridge
- I2C, UART, GPIO, and C2D ports
- Built-in REG1117 5V to 3.3V LDO
- 2 layer PCB
- Designed for ILI9225 SPI TFT display
